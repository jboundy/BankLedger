## Justin Boundy Code Challenge ##

This Readme contains some information about the project and instructions on setup

### Technologies ###

- The project is built on dotnet core 2.1. 
- There is an incomplete Asp.Net Core MVC application built with Bootstrap 4 and ViewComponents

### Instructions ###
- To run the console application, open the command line, find the dll file in the bin directory and use the command "dotnet (thedllfilenamehere)"

### Improvements ###
- While not required, unit tests would make the application more confident.
- The UI components for the console app were very linear. Readability improvements could be made by breaking up the code.
